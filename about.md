# Bio

I was born in Montevideo (Uruguay) where I lived until I was 23.

I graduated as a Computer Engineer from Universidad de la Republica (UdelaR) on 2017, and that same year I left for France, where I pursued my Ph.D.

My Ph.D, mostly Game Theory applied to Smart Grids revolved around the following question: How can we design incentives so that customers offer as much energy flexibility as possible?

I lived in Paris from 2017 until mid 2020, when I moved to Brussels to work for Centrica Business Solutions Belgium as an Optimization Engineer (mostly R&D).

Since Februrary 2021, I am working at Tryolabs and living once again in Montevideo.
